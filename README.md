# Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:

To write a program to predict the profit of a city using the linear regression model with gradient descent.

## Equipments Required:

1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm

1.Load the dataset from the CSV file and extract input (x) and output (y) values.

2.Initialize weight (w), bias (b), and learning rate (α).

3.Predict output using y = wx + b, compute error, and update w and b using gradient descent.

4.Repeat the process for a fixed number of iterations and display the regression line and results. 

## Program:

## Output:



## Result:

Thus the program to implement the linear regression using gradient descent is written and verified using python programming.
